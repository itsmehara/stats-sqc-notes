Here are simple and short notes explaining the causes of variation in Statistical Quality Control (SQC). 

These are key concepts for understanding when a process is "under control" or "out-of-control."

### Notes on Causes of Variation

Variation (difference between products) in manufacturing is unavoidable; it is a fact of industrial life. Even if a production process is well-designed, **no two products are identical**. The main goal of SQC is to **trace the sources of this variation** and try to eliminate them whenever possible.

Causes of variation are broadly classified into two categories:

---

#### 1. Chance Causes (Random, Natural, or Common Causes)

These causes are typically the **normal, built-in variability** of the process.

| What they are | Details for Quick Read | Process Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition:** | These are unavoidable, small, random factors present even in a **well-designed and carefully maintained process**. They cause slight variation in the product. | If only chance causes are present, the process is considered **under statistical control**. |
| **Impact:** | They affect the process output in **minor ways**. Collectively, they produce random results. Variation due to chance causes is generally considered **tolerable**. |
| **Examples:** | Slight differences in purchased material, poor lighting, inflexibility of aged machines, or the extent of worker training. |
| **Controllability:** | These causes are **not controllable** by workers; eliminating them usually requires **process redesign or modification** and is the responsibility of the management. |

#### 2. Assignable Causes (Special, Non-Random, or Unnatural Causes)

These causes represent specific, identifiable failures or disturbances in the process.

| What they are | Details for Quick Read | Process Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition:** | These causes are *not* part of the normal process design but occur **occasionally** due to specific factors. Their presence signals that something has gone specifically wrong. | If assignable causes are present, the process is considered **out-of-control**. |
| **Impact:** | The variability they cause is generally **larger** than that caused by chance factors, and they represent an **unacceptable level** of process performance. |
| **Examples:** | Accidental improper machine setting, using a batch of defective raw material, a worker falling ill, or breakages/misreading of scales. |
| **Controllability:** | These causes are **controllable**. Since their effect is localized, they can be eliminated by **workers or their immediate supervisor**. Corrective action must be taken to investigate and eliminate them quickly. |

### Key SQC Insight (Control Chart Connection)

The fundamental purpose of the control chart (the main tool for Statistical Process Control) is to distinguish between these two types of variation.

*   If sample points fall **within the control limits**, only **Chance Causes** are present, and the process is stable (under statistical control).
*   If **one or more sample points fall outside the control limits**, it alarms that **Assignable Causes** are present, and the process is unstable (out-of-control).
