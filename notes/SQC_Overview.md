### Notes on Statistical Quality Control (SQC)

#### 1. Defining Quality

Quality is a fundamental concept in manufacturing and service industries. It has evolved over time, moving from a simple definition to a customer-focused perspective:

*   **Dictionary Meaning:** Quality fundamentally means the **Degree of Excellence**. However, this is quite subjective as "excellence" varies greatly from person to person.
*   **Initial Definition:** Quality was first defined as **conforming to specifications**. But this was limited, as sometimes a product might meet specs but still not be very useful (utility is low).
*   **Modified Definitions:**
    *   Later, it included **fitness for use**.
    *   Then, it became about **customer satisfaction**.
    *   Moving further, the definitions became more aspirational: **delighting the customer** (fulfilling both expressed and unexpressed needs).
    *   Finally, **enchanting the customers** was proposed.
*   **In Summary:** For industries today, quality incorporates meeting specifications, fitness for use, and achieving various levels of customer delight or enchantment. A product is of good quality if it fulfills the specifications needed for its proper use.

#### 2. Dimensions of Quality

David A. Garvin, in 1988, summarized eight basic elements that define quality. These are known as the **dimensions of quality**:

1.  **Performance:** This is the primary characteristic of the product—how well it works. For example, judging a mobile phone by its sound clarity or a motorcycle by its fuel efficiency.
2.  **Features:** These are the extra characteristics provided along with the main function. Think of complementary snacks on a flight or Bluetooth capability on a mobile phone.
3.  **Reliability:** This refers to the probability that a product will fail within a specified time period. If a product (like a TV) needs frequent repair, it is considered unreliable. Reliability also relates to product life (durability).
4.  **Conformance (Agreement):** This means the product meets the specified standards or requirements.
5.  **Durability:** This is essentially a measure of the product's life.
6.  **Serviceability:** (A factor related to ease of repair or maintenance).
7.  **Aesthetics:** This refers to the sensory appeal—how the product looks, sounds, or feels.
8.  **Reputation:** This relates to the company’s track record or the past performance of the product.

#### 3. Defining Quality Control (QC)

**Control** generally means the procedure applied to meet a specification or standard. The process involves setting standards, measuring actual performance, comparing it with the standard, and taking necessary action if there is a difference.

**Quality Control (QC)** is defined as:
"The process by which we **measure the quality characteristics** of the product, **compare** them with the specifications or standard and take **suitable actions** whenever there is a difference between actual quality and the specifications or standard".

Historically, QC evolved from inspection by a single craftsman, to a foreman, then a specialized full-time inspector, eventually leading to SQC.

#### 4. Defining Statistical Quality Control (SQC)

SQC uses statistical tools and methods to monitor and maintain quality.

**SQC is defined as:**
The technique of applying **statistical methods** based on the theory of **probability and sampling** to establish the quality standard and maintain it in the **most economical manner**.

SQC was first developed by **Walter Shewhart** in the 1920s.

### Elements and Techniques of SQC

#### 5. Elements of SQC

The main components that make up SQC are:

*   **Sample Inspection:** SQC avoids 100% inspection (which is costly and sometimes destructive, e.g., testing a light bulb). It relies on inspecting a small, randomly selected group of items (a sample).
*   **Use of Statistical Methods:** SQC relies heavily on statistical tools like random sampling, mean, standard deviation, and statistical distributions (like Binomial, Poisson, Normal).
*   **Fundamental Objective:** The goal is to determine if a product meets its specifications. If there's variation, the objective is to **trace and eliminate the causes of that variation**.
*   **Decision Making:** SQC helps in making a binary decision: whether the process/product quality is **under control** or **out-of-control**.
*   **Specifications, Production, and Inspection:** SQC provides a framework for coordinating these three aspects of manufacturing.

#### 6. Techniques of SQC

The important techniques used in SQC are broadly divided into two major categories:

1.  **Statistical Process Control (SPC) or Process Control**.
2.  **Product Control** (often achieved through Acceptance Sampling).

#### 7. Statistical Process Control (SPC)

SPC is the first part of SQC and focuses on the manufacturing process itself.

*   **What is it?** SPC is a technique used to understand and monitor the process by collecting periodic data on quality characteristics, analyzing them, and taking suitable actions when there is deviation from the standard.
*   **Goal:** To achieve **process stability** and continuous improvements in product quality.
*   **Key Tools of SPC:** The most important tool is the **Control Chart**. SPC techniques include control charts, histograms, Pareto charts, cause and effect diagrams, etc..

*   **SPC Control Charts (Based on Magnitude of Shift Detection):**
    *   **Phase I (Shewhart Control Charts):** These are commonly used charts that detect **large variations/shifts**. They focus only on the information provided by the latest sample.
        *   **For Variables (Measurable characteristics):** $\overline{X}$-chart (for process mean), R-chart or S-chart (for process variability/dispersion).
        *   **For Attributes (Non-measurable/Count data):** p-chart (for fraction defective), np-chart (for number of defectives), c-chart (for number of defects in a unit), u-chart (for number of defects per unit).
    *   **Phase II (Advanced Control Charts):** These charts are more sensitive and are used to detect **small shifts** (generally smaller than 1.5 $\sigma$). These are typically implemented after the process is initially stabilized using Phase I charts.
        *   **Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) chart**.
        *   **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart**.

#### 8. Product Control

Product control is the second major part of SQC.

*   **What is it?** It involves inspecting the quality of already produced units or items received from suppliers to ensure they are **free from defects** and **conform to specifications**.
*   **When is it needed?** It is crucial when a manufacturer purchases components from outside agents and does not have direct control over their quality, or when ensuring the final lot meets specifications.
*   **How is it achieved?** Product control is primarily achieved through **Acceptance Sampling** (or sampling inspection).
*   **Acceptance Sampling:** This technique involves randomly selecting a small fraction of items from a large collection (a lot) and inspecting them to decide whether the entire lot should be accepted or rejected based on the sample findings.
*   **Product Control Topics:** Block 2 covers topics related to acceptance sampling like:
    *   Acceptance Sampling Plans.
    *   Rectifying Sampling Plans (where rejected lots are 100% inspected and fixed).
    *   Single and Double Sampling Plans.
    *   Related characteristics: Operating Characteristic (OC) curve,
        Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ), Producer’s Risk, Consumer’s Risk, Average Sample Number (ASN), and Average Total Inspection (ATI).
